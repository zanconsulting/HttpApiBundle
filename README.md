# HttpApiBundle
Easily add a json-based REST api to Symfony 2

This bundle makes it easy to set up an API that communicates via JSON-encoded requests and responses.

*Requests* either use the GET method or have a json-encoded set of parameters in the body of the request.

*Responses* are json-encoded.

## Features

 * Controllers return data as arrays or anything that JMS Serializer can process
 * Request data is automatically processed to appear as normal POST parameters
 
## ToDo
 * Pretty much everything, this is an early WIP
